INSTANCE VARIABLES:
Basically name is given to memory location. It is basic unit storage in program.
These variables are declard within clas but outside the method,Constructor,Block or dedualt values also.
1.These variables are created when we create basically create object. And are distroyed when object is destroy.
2.We may use access speciefiers gor instance variable. If we may not access specifiers then we will get default access specifiers.
3.Each and every object have its own copy of instance variables.

Example:
Class Text:
       int count=100     ##instance variable
      Statements

LOCAL VARIABLES:
These variables are declared within the method but do not get any default values.
That are usually created when we enter a method or contrsuctor and are distroy after exiting method or when call returns from the mothod
Initialization of local variable is mandatory
Example:
int area()      
{    
        int length = 10; // Local variable          
        int breadth = 5; // Local variable          
        int rectarea = length*breadth; // Local variable          
        return rectarea;          
}

They are defined in class but outside the body of methods.  	                  They are defined as a type of variable declared within programming blocks or subroutines. 
These variables are created when an object is instantiated and are
 accessible to all constructors, methods, or blocks in class.                              These variables are created when a block, method or constructor is started and the variable will be destroyed once it exits the block, method, or constructor.
These variables are destroyed when the object is destroyed.  	                  These variables are destroyed when the constructor or method is exited.
It can be accessed throughout the class.  	                                                        Its access is limited to the method in which it is declared.
They are used to reserving memory for data that the 
class needs and that too for the lifetime of the object.                          	They are used to decreasing dependencies between components I.e., the complexity of code is decreased.
These variables are given a default value if it is not assigned by code.       	These variables do not always have some value, so there must be a value assigned by code.
It is not compulsory to initialize instance variables before use.  	                   It is important to initialize local variables before use.
It includes access modifiers such as private, public, protected, etc.  	It does not include any access modifiers such as private, public, protected, etc.


CLASS VARIABLES:
 It is basically a static variable that can be declared anywhere at class level with static. Across different objects, these variables can have only one value. These variables are not tied to any particular object of the class, therefore, can share across all objects of the class.  

Example:
class Taxes  
{  
   static int count;  
   /*...*/  
}  


Static variables.
                                                                                                                                                                                                               Class Variable.
It is a variable whose value is instance-specific and now shared among instances.  	                                  It is a variable that defines a specific attribute or property for a class.  
These variables cannot be shared between classes. Instead, they only belong to one specific class.  	These variables can be shared between class and its subclasses. 
It usually reserves memory for data that the class needs.  	                                                                     It usually maintains a single shared value for all instances of class even if no instance object of the class exists.  
It is generally created when an instance of the class is created.                                                             	It is generally created when the program begins to execute.  
It normally retains values as long as the object exists.  	                                                                       It normally retains values until the program terminates.
It has many copies so every object has its own personal copy of the instance variable.                     	It has only one copy of the class variable so it is shared among different objects of the class.  
It can be accessed directly by calling variable names inside the class.  	                                                    It can be accessed by calling with the class name.  
These variables are declared without using the static keyword.  	                                                                       These variables are declared using the keyword static.  
Changes that are made to these variables through one object will not reflect in another object.  	                Changes that are made to these variables through one object will reflect in another object.
